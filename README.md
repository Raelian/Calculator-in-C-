# Calculator-in-C-

This was a simple project done with Visual Studio 2023 in C# where I attempted to create a calculator by using Windows Forms App.
The calculator allows the following mathematical operations:
- addition
- substraction
- multiplication
- division
The calculator works with both whole numbers and decimals by adding a decimal point button.
Finally, the "Clear" and "C" buttons were introduced as options to clear the whole screen or the last number/operation/dot on screen.
The calculator app can be accessed through Calculator\Calculator\obj\Debug\Calculator.exe
